I recently completed guided project **Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office** in DataCamp. This is the complete project file.

This project mainly focuses on,
- Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary.
- A visual inspection of our data.
- Deciding which kind of vizualilation conveys the right message from the data.
